### Attribute System

**Assumption:**
This RPG takes place in a low-fantasy world where characters are capable but grounded, emphasizing survival, tactical combat, and problem-solving. The tone is gritty but not excessively harsh, allowing players to grow their characters into heroes over time.

**1. Attribute Names:**
We will use five core attributes to balance simplicity with meaningful differentiation between characters.

- **Might** – Represents physical strength, endurance, and the ability to perform feats of power.
- **Agility** – Measures reflexes, balance, and coordination, affecting actions requiring speed or precision.
- **Vitality** – Reflects toughness, health, and overall resilience to damage and fatigue.
- **Wits** – Governs quick thinking, perception, and problem-solving skills in dynamic situations.
- **Presence** – Captures force of personality, leadership, and social influence.

These attributes are versatile and applicable to combat, exploration, and social challenges, ensuring characters feel well-rounded.

**2. Attribute Generation Method:**
To maintain balance and provide flexibility, players can choose between two generation methods:

- **Rolling Dice:** Roll 4d6, dropping the lowest die. Repeat this process five times and assign each result to the attribute of your choice.
- **Standard Array:** Players distribute the following scores among their attributes: **15, 14, 13, 12, 10.**

This hybrid method gives players the option for randomness or a predictable, balanced approach.

**3. Attribute Scale:**
- **Range:** 3 to 18 at character creation, based on dice rolls or point distribution. A score of 10 represents the average, with higher scores reflecting talent and lower scores indicating weakness.
- **Maximum:** 20 (achievable through leveling or magical enhancements later in the game).

- **Impact on Gameplay:**
  - **Attribute Modifier Formula:** (Attribute - 10) / 2, rounded down. For example, a Might score of 18 results in a +4 modifier, while a score of 8 results in a -1 modifier.
  - **Examples:**
    - **Might 18** grants +4 to melee attack rolls and strength-based checks.
    - **Agility 14** provides +2 to dodge and ranged attack rolls.
    - **Vitality 16** gives +3 to health rolls and endurance-based saving throws.
    - **Wits 12** results in +1 to initiative rolls and perception checks.
    - **Presence 10** offers no modifier to persuasion or intimidation checks, maintaining the average level.

This scale keeps math minimal while allowing meaningful character differences to emerge.
