### Skill System

**Assumption:**
The game world is low-fantasy, gritty, and survival-focused, where problem-solving, combat, and social influence play key roles. Characters are grounded but capable, evolving into heroes over time. The challenges characters face will often test their skills and adaptability, rewarding those who can think creatively and apply their abilities in various ways.

**1. Skill List:**

The following skills reflect the game's emphasis on survival, exploration, combat, and social interaction. Each skill is tied to one of the core attributes: Might, Agility, Vitality, Wits, or Presence. This list is designed to give players a broad range of options while ensuring that each skill remains distinct and relevant across different scenarios.

- **Athletics** (Might) – Climbing, swimming, jumping, and feats of physical exertion. Useful for scaling obstacles, escaping danger, and performing acts of raw strength.
- **Melee Combat** (Might) – Proficiency with close-range weapons like swords, axes, and maces. Governs attack accuracy and damage output in melee engagements.
- **Ranged Combat** (Agility) – Proficiency with ranged weapons such as bows and crossbows. Essential for dealing damage from a distance, often crucial for hunting or engaging enemies safely.
- **Stealth** (Agility) – Moving silently, hiding, and sneaking. Vital for ambushes, avoiding detection, and bypassing dangerous encounters.
- **Acrobatics** (Agility) – Tumbling, balancing, and performing agile maneuvers. Helpful for dodging attacks, crossing narrow paths, or dazzling enemies with quick movements.
- **Endurance** (Vitality) – Resisting fatigue, hunger, or environmental hazards. Determines how well a character can survive prolonged exposure to harsh conditions or physical strain.
- **Survival** (Wits) – Tracking, foraging, and navigating the wilderness. Crucial for sustaining oneself in the wild, finding food, and understanding natural patterns.
- **Perception** (Wits) – Spotting hidden dangers, noticing small details, and staying alert. Influences the detection of traps, secret doors, and incoming threats.
- **Crafting** (Wits) – Creating or repairing weapons, armor, and tools. Enables the production of useful gear and enhancements, allowing characters to prepare for upcoming challenges.
- **Investigation** (Wits) – Analyzing clues, solving puzzles, and searching for information. Useful for unraveling mysteries and uncovering secrets.
- **Persuasion** (Presence) – Convincing others, negotiation, and diplomacy. Allows characters to influence NPCs and resolve conflicts without violence.
- **Intimidation** (Presence) – Coercing others through fear or force of personality. Often used to assert dominance or compel obedience.
- **Deception** (Presence) – Lying, disguising, and bluffing. Helps in misdirection and concealing one’s true intentions.
- **Leadership** (Presence) – Inspiring and directing allies, boosting morale. Improves group performance and can turn the tide of battle through coordination.

**2. Skill Acquisition:**

- **Level-Based System:**
  - At character creation, players select **5 skills** to begin with, each starting at **Rank 1**. This ensures a balanced spread of initial expertise, allowing for differentiation in party roles.
  - Upon leveling up, characters choose **2 skills** to increase by **1 rank**. This process encourages gradual growth and specialization without overwhelming complexity.
  - At experience levels divisible by 5 (e.g., level 5, 10, 15), characters may select **1 new skill** at **Rank 1** to add to their repertoire.
  - The maximum rank for any skill is **5**, representing mastery. Reaching this cap provides characters with notable advantages in that area, reinforcing their role within the group.
  - Skills can be learned by any character, regardless of class, ensuring flexibility. This allows players to build versatile characters or double down on class strengths.
  - As characters grow, they may encounter trainers, books, or unique experiences that provide bonus skill ranks outside of normal level progression.

**3. Skill Use:**

Skill checks are performed by rolling a d20, adding the relevant attribute modifier, and the skill rank. This straightforward approach keeps gameplay moving quickly while allowing for meaningful character customization.

**Example:**  
To sneak past a guard, a player rolls a d20, adds their **Agility modifier** and their **Stealth skill rank**. The result is compared to a target number (set by the GM based on the guard's alertness and environment). Environmental conditions and situational modifiers may further influence the outcome.

- A **Stealth (Agility)** check for a character with **Agility +2** and **Stealth Rank 3** would roll:  
  **d20 + 2 (Agility) + 3 (Skill Rank)**.  

- Failure is possible even with training, maintaining risk and excitement in gameplay. However, situational bonuses may apply if the player describes an especially clever or advantageous action.
- Critical successes (natural 20) and failures (natural 1) can result in extraordinary outcomes, adding drama and unpredictability to skill-based actions.

**Guiding Philosophy:**
- Characters can specialize in a few skills or spread their growth across multiple areas. Specialization rewards consistency, while diversification allows adaptability.
- Overlapping skills like Persuasion and Intimidation allow for different approaches to social encounters, providing players with choices that suit their character’s personality and strengths.
- The system maintains simplicity and flexibility, with skills tied directly to attributes, ensuring streamlined resolution and meaningful progression. This design enhances immersion by reinforcing player decisions and creating distinct character identities.
- Skills are designed to have broad applications, ensuring that even niche skills remain relevant across different scenarios, encouraging creative problem-solving and engagement.
