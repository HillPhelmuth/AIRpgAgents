### Alignment System for Our RPG

---

#### 1. Good-Evil Axis

**Good:**
Characters aligned with Good prioritize altruism, compassion, and the welfare of others. They are guided by principles of justice and mercy, often risking their own safety for the greater good. These individuals go out of their way to protect the weak, confront oppression, and foster harmony. Examples include helping those in need, defending the innocent, and upholding moral integrity even at personal cost. Their actions may sometimes seem overly idealistic, but they are fueled by a strong belief in making the world a better place, even when it requires personal sacrifice or enduring significant challenges.

**Neutral:**
Neutral characters walk a balanced path, often acting pragmatically and evaluating situations based on their immediate needs or long-term goals. They may help or harm others depending on what benefits them or their close allies, but they generally avoid extreme positions. Neutrality allows for adaptability, with these characters often serving as mediators or opportunists. They might step in to restore balance when either Good or Evil grows too dominant, or they might prioritize personal survival above all else. This approach can make them enigmatic and unpredictable allies or foes, as their motivations are deeply tied to context rather than overarching moral convictions.

**Evil:**
Evil characters are driven by self-interest, malice, or ambition, showing little regard for others' welfare. They manipulate, exploit, and destroy to achieve their desires, whether out of greed, vengeance, or sheer cruelty. Their actions often sow discord and suffering, leaving a trail of chaos in their wake. While some Evil characters are overtly malicious, others are cunning and subtle, working behind the scenes to achieve their goals. They may justify their actions as necessary or even righteous, but their underlying motivations are rooted in personal gain or a thirst for power, often at great cost to others.

#### 2. Unique Axis: Passion vs. Reason

**Passionate:**
Characters driven by Passion act based on their emotions, instincts, and desires. They are spontaneous, intense, and often impulsive. Passionate characters prioritize their feelings and personal connections, making decisions based on what feels right in the moment. They thrive in chaotic situations where quick, emotional decisions are paramount. This alignment often manifests as fierce loyalty to loved ones, burning hatred for enemies, or a relentless drive to achieve a personal goal. Passionate characters may struggle with self-control and long-term planning, but their fervor can inspire others and lead to remarkable achievements fueled by sheer determination.

**Neutral:**
Characters in the Neutral position between Passion and Reason weigh both emotional and logical considerations. They strike a balance between following their heart and their head, adapting their approach depending on the circumstances. They are versatile decision-makers, able to navigate both emotional and rational conflicts. This alignment reflects a pragmatic and well-rounded mindset, allowing characters to assess the merits of emotional impulses and calculated plans without fully committing to either. Neutral characters may be the stabilizing forces in a group, mediating disputes and ensuring decisions reflect both short-term needs and long-term outcomes.

**Reasonable:**
Reasonable characters prioritize logic, planning, and careful consideration. They approach situations analytically, often suppressing emotions to focus on outcomes. Reasonable characters excel in structured environments that reward long-term thinking and deliberate action, but they may struggle with connecting to others emotionally. This alignment is often seen in characters who value strategy, knowledge, and precision. While their detachment can be a strength, it may also alienate them from allies who value emotional bonds and spontaneity. Reasonable characters may serve as the voice of reason in chaotic situations, guiding groups toward calculated success.

#### 3. Combined Alignments

The interaction of these axes creates a rich spectrum of character motivations and behaviors. Here are a few expanded examples:

**Good and Passionate:**
A crusader who fights for justice with fiery zeal, driven by a deep emotional connection to their cause. They may sometimes act recklessly, but their intentions are pure. This character might charge into danger to save innocent lives, fueled by a deep sense of empathy and a need to act immediately when they perceive suffering or injustice.

**Neutral and Reasonable:**
A tactician who evaluates every situation with careful analysis, always choosing the most practical path to achieve their goals, regardless of emotional appeals or moral extremes. They might lead a group through treacherous terrain or negotiate a delicate truce, relying on their sharp mind to weigh the risks and benefits of every option.

**Evil and Passionate:**
A vengeful tyrant who lets their hatred and ambition fuel their actions. They are unpredictable and dangerous, acting on their darkest impulses without hesitation. This character might ruthlessly pursue personal revenge or lash out at those who oppose them, often to the detriment of long-term alliances or plans.

**Good and Reasonable:**
A wise leader who champions justice and fairness through careful planning and diplomacy. They ensure that every decision aligns with their moral principles while minimizing harm. Such a character might broker peace between warring factions, leveraging their intelligence and foresight to create lasting solutions.

**Evil and Reasonable:**
A calculating villain who pursues power through meticulous schemes, avoiding unnecessary cruelty to maintain control. They may orchestrate elaborate plots to undermine their rivals or manipulate others to achieve their ambitions, always with a focus on efficiency and precision.

#### 4. Theurgic Magic Alignment

**Impact of Alignment on Theurgic Magic:**
Theurgic magic reflects the character’s relationship with their deity. A character’s alignment must align with their deity’s principles to maintain full access to divine power. For example:

- **Good characters** may be favored with healing spells, blessings, and protection magic. They are often viewed as champions of their deity’s will, receiving consistent guidance and favor.
- **Neutral characters** might have access to a balanced mix of offensive and defensive spells but must tread carefully to avoid alienating their deity. Their connection is stable as long as they avoid extremes.
- **Evil characters** can wield destructive and manipulative divine powers but risk divine punishment if their actions disrupt their patron’s goals. They might be tasked with acts of corruption or conquest to maintain their favor.

**Restrictions:**
- Healing magic is generally reserved for Good or Neutral characters, reflecting divine compassion and benevolence.
- Evil characters may access potent curses and destructive spells but may struggle to use restorative abilities effectively, as their magic leans toward harm rather than healing.

**Dynamic Alignment Effects:**
- **Devotion and Piety:** A character’s standing with their deity changes based on their actions. Frequent alignment shifts might weaken their connection to divine power, forcing characters to atone or embrace their deity’s values more fully.
- **Redemption and Corruption:** Characters can realign themselves with their deity through atonement (for Good or Neutral characters) or by furthering a deity’s dark ambitions (for Evil characters). This dynamic encourages players to consider the long-term consequences of their actions.
