## Combat System

---

### 1. Initiative

**Determining Initiative:**\
Initiative is determined individually at the start of combat. Each character rolls a **d20** and adds their **Agility modifier** and **Wits modifier** to the roll. This reflects both physical reflexes and mental sharpness.

**Formula:**\
**Initiative = d20 + Agility Modifier + Wits Modifier**

**Tiebreaker:**\
In the event of a tie:

- The character with the higher **Wits** attribute acts first.
- If Wits are also tied, the character with the highest **Agility** attribute wins.
- If all are equal, the characters act simultaneously.

### 2. Actions

**Action Types:**\
On their turn, a character can take one of the following actions:

- **Move:** Move up to a distance equal to 30 feet or their movement speed. Moving past enemies may provoke an **Attack of Opportunity**.
- **Attack:** Make one attack against an opponent using a melee or ranged weapon.
- **Cast a Spell:** Cast one spell, following the rules outlined in the Magic System【11†source】.
- **Use an Item:** Use a potion, tool, or other item.
- **Dodge:** Focus on defense, gaining +2 to Armor Class (AC) until the start of the next turn.
- **Help:** Grant an ally advantage on their next attack or skill check.
- **Disengage:** Move without provoking Attacks of Opportunity.
- **Grapple or Shove:** Engage in close combat control, using an Athletics (Might) check opposed by Agility.

**Action Economy:**

- **1 Action per Turn** – A character can perform one main action and move during their turn.
- **Bonus Actions:** Certain abilities, spells, or traits allow a bonus action. Only one bonus action may be used per turn.
- **Reactions:** A character may take one reaction per round, typically in response to enemy actions (e.g., counterattacks or parries).

### 3. Attacks

**Making an Attack:**\
To attack, roll a **d20** and add the relevant attribute modifier and skill rank.

- **Melee Attacks** – d20 + Might modifier + Melee Combat skill rank.
- **Ranged Attacks** – d20 + Agility modifier + Ranged Combat skill rank.

**Attack Roll vs. Armor Class (AC):**\
If the attack roll equals or exceeds the target's AC, the attack hits.

**Armor Class (AC):**\
AC represents how hard a character is to hit.

- **Base AC = 10 + Agility Modifier**
- **Armor:** Provides a flat AC bonus based on its type.
- **Shields:** Grant an additional +2 to AC.

---

### 4. Damage

**Calculating Damage:**\
When an attack hits, roll the weapon’s damage die and add the relevant attribute modifier.

- **Melee Damage:** Weapon damage + Might modifier.
- **Ranged Damage:** Weapon damage + Agility modifier.

**Critical Hits:**\
On a natural 20, the attack is a **critical hit**. Roll the weapon’s damage die **twice** and add the results together, then add the attribute modifier.

**Weapon Damage Example:**

- **Sword (1d8)** – On hit: 1d8 + Might modifier. On critical: 2d8 + Might modifier.
- **Bow (1d6)** – On hit: 1d6 + Agility modifier. On critical: 2d6 + Agility modifier.

---

### 5. Defense

**Defensive Options:**

- **Dodge (Action):** Gain +2 AC until the start of your next turn.
- **Cover (Reaction):** Partial cover grants +2 AC, full cover grants +5 AC.
- **Parry (Reaction):** When attacked, a character may spend their reaction to roll a d20. If the result + Agility modifier exceeds the attack roll, the attack is deflected.

---

### 6. Hit Points and Damage

**Hit Points (HP):**\
Hit Points represent a character's vitality. At level 1, HP is determined by the character’s race and class.

- **Base HP = 10 + Vitality modifier**【8†source】.
- Each level grants additional HP based on the class, typically a d8 or d10 + Vitality modifier.

**Damage and Healing:**

- Subtract damage taken from current HP.
- Healing restores HP, but cannot exceed maximum HP.

**Zero HP:**\
When a character reaches 0 HP:

- **Unconscious** – The character falls unconscious but is not dead.
- **Death Saving Throws:** Each round, the character rolls a d20. On a 10 or higher, they succeed. Three successes stabilize the character; three failures result in death.
- **Instant Death:** If damage exceeds twice the character’s maximum HP, they die instantly.

---

### Lethality and Complexity

- **Combat Lethality:** Moderately lethal. Characters can survive several hits but must tactically manage their defenses.
- **Randomness:** Dice rolls determine success, but modifiers from skills and attributes minimize total randomness, ensuring skilled characters perform reliably.
- **Tactical Depth:** Combat encourages smart positioning, defense actions, and use of class abilities for a balance of simplicity and strategic options.
