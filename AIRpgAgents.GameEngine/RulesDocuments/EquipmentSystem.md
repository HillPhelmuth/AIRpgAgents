**Equipment System**

## 1. Currency

**Commonality and Form:**  
Money exists in the form of coins minted by various kingdoms and city-states. Most transactions use silver pieces, with gold pieces reserved for larger purchases. Copper pieces exist but are mainly used by common folk. In remote areas, barter is still widely practiced, with goods such as livestock, grain, or crafted tools often being exchanged instead of coinage.

**Coin Denominations and Exchange Rates:**  
- **1 Gold Piece (gp) = 10 Silver Pieces (sp)**  
- **1 Silver Piece (sp) = 10 Copper Pieces (cp)**  
- **1 Platinum Piece (pp) = 10 Gold Pieces (gp)** (rarely used outside of noble or royal transactions)

Wealth is not evenly distributed, and characters may find themselves struggling for resources early on. Finding treasure, completing quests, or even taking on mercenary work can supplement income for gear purchases. In cities, banks or wealthy merchants may provide safekeeping for large sums of money, but carrying excessive wealth in dangerous areas increases the risk of theft.

## 2. Weapons

Weapons play a vital role in both combat and survival, with adventurers often relying on their effectiveness to overcome threats. The variety of available weaponry allows for different fighting styles, from precise, quick strikes to heavy, crushing blows.

## Design Considerations

- **Skill Integration:** Thieves’ tools require Stealth or Crafting skills, while weapons align with combat skills.
- **Survival Elements:** Items like Rations and Waterskins reinforce resource management in the setting.
- **Progression:** High-cost armor like Plate incentivizes saving money or finding rewards during adventures.
- **Customization:** Additional exotic or magical gear can be introduced at the GM’s discretion.
- **Encumbrance:** Carrying excessive weight may impact movement, stealth, and endurance.
